# Marketing Plan Placeholder

Use this document to outline how Bradley Digital Marketing Hub supports a basic marketing workflow:

1. **Plan campaigns** – Capture platform, goal, budget, and outline details using `CampaignPlannerView`. Save each plan to CloudKit for tracking.
2. **Generate content** – Use `ContentGeneratorView` to draft deterministic captions and push selected ideas to the content calendar.
3. **Schedule posts** – Organize every caption, platform, and publish date within `ContentCalendarView`, grouped by brand.
4. **Use templates** – Pull from CloudKit-hosted templates for plug-and-play scripts, decks, and swipe files.
5. **Track affiliate clicks** – Share affiliate resources inside the Affiliate tab and log each click with `AffiliateClick` records for future reporting.
