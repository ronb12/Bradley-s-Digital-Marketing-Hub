# Affiliate Strategy Overview

Bradley Digital Marketing Hub weaves affiliate education into the product experience:

- **Dedicated tab** – `AffiliateToolsView` showcases curated tools with descriptions, Pro-recommended badges, and quick launch buttons.
- **Contextual cards** – Campaign planning and dashboard surfaces highlight recommended tools relevant to the current workflow.
- **Click tracking** – Every tap saves an `AffiliateClick` record (userId, toolId, timestamp) so you can measure engagement or sync with external reporting later.
- **Best practices** – Provide value first, frame tools as helpful workflow accelerators, and clearly label sponsored or agency-only picks. Update CloudKit public data to refresh recommendations anytime without shipping a new build.
