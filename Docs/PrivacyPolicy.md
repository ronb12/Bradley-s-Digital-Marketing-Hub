# Privacy Policy
_Last updated: November 30, 2025_

Bradley Virtual Solutions, LLC ("Bradley Virtual", "we", "us", or "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect through Bradley Digital Marketing Hub (the "App"), how we use it, and the choices you have.

## 1. Data We Collect
### Account Data
- **Apple ID Identifier**: We receive a unique, app-scoped identifier from Sign in with Apple. Name and email are only provided on first sign-in if you grant permission.
- **Profile Fields**: Optional business name, business type, and plan status are stored in your private CloudKit database.

### Marketing Content
- **Brands, Campaigns, Calendar Items, Bookings**: Created content, notes, budgets, and schedules are stored privately in your CloudKit container.
- **Templates & Affiliate Tools**: These may be stored in the public CloudKit database if you choose to publish assets for wider use.

### Usage & Diagnostics
- The App uses minimal local analytics (e.g., toggles saved in `UserDefaults`) to personalize experiences. We do not embed third-party analytics SDKs.

## 2. How We Use Data
- Provide and maintain your marketing workspace.
- Sync subscription entitlements and enforce plan limits.
- Surface affiliate recommendations and log click events you initiate.
- Respond to support requests.

## 3. How Data Is Stored & Shared
- **CloudKit**: Data lives in Apple’s CloudKit infrastructure, scoped to your Apple ID. Public data (templates, affiliate metadata) can be viewed by other users.
- **On-Device Storage**: Limited preferences and cached identifiers are stored via `UserDefaults`.
- **No Sale of Data**: We do not sell or rent your personal data. We only share it with Apple services necessary for authentication, subscriptions, and syncing.

## 4. Subscriptions & Payments
Payments are processed exclusively through Apple’s in-app purchase system. We do not collect or store your payment information.

## 5. Data Retention
- Private records remain until you delete them via the App or remove the App’s iCloud data from your device settings.
- If you remove the App or Sign in with Apple access, linked CloudKit data may remain until deleted manually.

## 6. Your Rights & Choices
- **Access & Deletion**: Manage or delete data directly inside the App. You can also remove the App’s CloudKit data from iOS Settings > Apple ID > iCloud > Manage Storage.
- **Sign in with Apple**: Revoke access anytime from your Apple ID settings, which may prevent future sign-ins.
- **Notifications**: Toggle in-App reminders via the onboarding screen or Profile settings.

## 7. Children’s Privacy
The App is intended for adults managing businesses. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.

## 8. Security
We rely on Apple’s security for authentication, CloudKit, and StoreKit. While we take reasonable steps, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.

## 9. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Changes will be dated at the top of this document. Continued use of the App after updates indicates acceptance.
